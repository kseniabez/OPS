mmap does more than take a file and map it to memory. 
It is the general interface for creating shared memory among processes.
 Currently it only supports regular files and POSIX shmem (“Mmap” #ref-mmap_2018).
  Naturally, you can read all about it in the reference above, which references the current working group POSIX standard. Some other options to note in the page will follow.
